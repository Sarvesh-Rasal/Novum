# Novum
Novum, in Latin, means ‘Revolution’. Novum is a potential idea of a system that helps remove repetitive tasks from the workflow of a human. Everything from pre-heating the oven to choosing the right clothes for the day will be handled by Novum.

 

Novum integrates IOT (Internet of Things), Mechanics, Electronics, Machine Learning and Data Science with the help of Artificial Intelligence. So, switching on your Geysers in the morning, handled by Novum, setting the temperature of your Air Conditioning, handled by Novum, should you carry an umbrella, let Novum decide.

The possibilities are endless. With the right kind of data and development, Novum has the potential to eliminate almost every repetitive task and make someone more productive.
